<h1 id="850words">850words</h1>
<p>Here is a list of 850 basic english words. I think It would be cool if I could see one word of them every time I create a new tab in my browser. It might be very useful for you If you just have started to learn a language. So I have started to develop a chrome extension for this. I am going to finish it soon. But you can try it right now.</p>
<p>I am russian so the site works only with EN-RU dictionary now. But if you want to see your language here, feel free to send a new pull request with it and I will create UI for choosing a language in settings. Dictionary is JSON file (e.g. “enru.json” for russian). You can do it here.</p>
